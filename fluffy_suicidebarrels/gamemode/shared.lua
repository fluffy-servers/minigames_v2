    Some explosive barrels have turned sentient.
    
    When a human is eliminated, they will join the Barrel team.
    
    Humans:
     Try to survive against the onslaught
     Shoot a barrel and it will explode instantly
     Be cautious! Don't shoot barrels to close to teammates
     
    Barrels:
     Try to eliminate all the humans before time runs out
     Left click to explode after a short delay
