# Minigames
## End of Life
Fluffy Servers has come to a close and, while I'd love to keep pouring my heart into Minigames, I don't have the time or passion to maintain this project like I used to. No further content is expected for Minigames.

If you're still making content for Minigames, please feel free to open a PR and I'll get around to reviewing it. If there's any developer features or tweaks you'd like made to the base, get in touch.

I'd like to thank everyone who played Minigames on Fluffy Servers in the three years we were running - special thanks to everyone who helped create content. Minigames has been a fantastic learning experience for me, and I hope that if you're reading this README that you can still find some value out of this project.

## Introduction
Minigames is a collection of exciting gamemodes developed by Fluffy Servers. We have new and original content, as well as remakes of gamemodes from the glory days of Fretta.

The original Minigames ran from November 2017 until April 2018. It was then revived in it's current form in November 2018, aiming to be a more polished experienced with even more gamemodes and original maps.

## Special Thanks
