## End of Life

### Maps

If you're looking for the maps for these gamemodes, the old Fluffy Servers map list is still available [here](https://fluffyservers.com/fastdlmg/maps/).

### March 2021 - Categories Update

The [March 2021 Garry's Mod Update](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/4000/view/2988675197234811880) adds support for gamemode categories on the server browser. I've quickly whipped up a [1.3.11 update](https://github.com/fluffy-servers/minigames_v2/releases/tag/1.3.11) which adds these categories to the Minigames gamemodes.

Also relevant - check out [the guide on how to use the proxy gamemode](https://github.com/fluffy-servers/minigames_v2/wiki/Server-Setup#proxy-gamemode) to keep your server stable in the server browser.

### So long, and thanks for all the fish

Fluffy Servers has come to a close and, while I'd love to keep pouring my heart into Minigames, I don't have the time or passion to maintain this project like I used to. No further content is expected for Minigames.

If you're still making content for Minigames, please feel free to open a PR and I'll get around to reviewing it. If there's any developer features or tweaks you'd like made to the base, get in touch.

I'd like to thank everyone who played Minigames on Fluffy Servers in the three years we were running - special thanks to everyone who helped create content. Minigames has been a fantastic learning experience for me, and I hope that if you're reading this README that you can still find some value out of this project.

## Introduction

Minigames is a collection of exciting gamemodes developed by Fluffy Servers. We have new and original content, as well as remakes of gamemodes from the glory days of Fretta.

The original Minigames ran from November 2017 until April 2018. It was then revived in it's current form in November 2018, aiming to be a more polished experienced with even more gamemodes and original maps.
