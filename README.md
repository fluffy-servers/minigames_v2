# Minigames
## Introduction
Minigames is a collection of exciting gamemodes developed by Fluffy Servers. We have new and original content, as well as remakes of gamemodes from the glory days of Fretta.

The original Minigames ran from November 2017 until April 2018. It was then revived in it's current form in November 2018, aiming to be a more polished experienced with even more gamemodes and original maps.
